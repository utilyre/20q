# 20Q

An awesome 20 questions game written in C ðŸš€

## How to play

It prompts you for a number in a specific range. You'll have three shots to
guess the number that has been chosen by your computer.

After the first guess, it'll tell you wether it was higher or lower than the
actuall number. You gotta adjust your guesses to get the right number.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ¤Ÿ
